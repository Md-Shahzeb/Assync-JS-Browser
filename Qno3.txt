Q3. What is the same-origin policy in the context of AJAX requests, and how can you work around it?
sol: The same-origin policy (SOP) is a security measure that restricts how documents and scripts interact with resources from different
     origins. It compares the origin of the requested resource to the current page, and only allows access if they match. An origin is
      made up of a URI scheme, domain, and port number. 
      The SOP helps isolate malicious documents, preventing them from attacking other websites. For example, it stops malicious websites
      from reading a user's webmail or company intranet data. However, it can also limit the functionality of legitimate web applications.
       For instance, a site can't request data from a different domain, even if the other domain is willing to provide it. 

       One way to work around the SOP limitations is to use JSONP to provide a proxy for the web service. This can be done by
       adding a script tag with a src attribute that points to a script hosted on any domain.
